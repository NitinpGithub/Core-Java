	 Basic Array Programs:
Find the Largest Element in an Array

Program to find the largest element in an array of integers.
Find the Smallest Element in an Array

Program to find the smallest element in an array.
Reverse an Array

Program to reverse the elements of an array in place.
Check if an Array is a Palindrome

Program to check if an array is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forward and backward).
Find the Missing Number in an Array

Count the Frequency of Each Element in an Array

Program to count how many times each element appears in an array.
Find the Second Largest Element in an Array

Program to find the second largest element in an unsorted array.
Remove Duplicate Elements from an Array

Program to remove duplicate elements from an array, keeping only unique elements.
Intermediate Array Programs:
Find the Sum of Elements in an Array

Program to find the sum of all elements in an integer array.
Find the Average of Elements in an Array

Program to find the average of the elements in the array.
Merge Two Sorted Arrays

Program to merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.
Find the Intersection of Two Arrays

Program to find the common elements between two arrays.
Find the Union of Two Arrays

Rotate an Array

Program to rotate the elements of an array to the right or left by a given number of positions.
Find the Kth Largest or Smallest Element in an Array

Program to find the Kth largest or smallest element in an array.
Move All Zeroes to the End of an Array

Program to move all zeroes in an array to the end without changing the order of non-zero elements.
Sort an Array Without Using Built-in Sort Methods

Program to sort an array using custom sorting logic (bubble sort, insertion sort, etc.).
Advanced Array Programs:
Find Pair with Given Sum in Array

Program to find if there exists a pair of elements in the array whose sum equals a given target value.
Find the Largest Sum Subarray (Kadane's Algorithm)

Program to find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum in a given array.
Find All Pairs with Given Sum in an Array

Program to find all pairs in the array that add up to a given sum.
Find the Subarray with the Maximum Product

Program to find the contiguous subarray that has the maximum product.
Find the Longest Subsequence of Array

Program to find the longest increasing subsequence in an array.
Find the Majority Element in an Array

Program to find the element in the array that appears more than half the time (i.e., the majority element).
Find the Minimum Distance Between Two Elements

Program to find the minimum distance between two elements in an array.
Find if Two Arrays are Equal or Not

Program to check whether two arrays are equal (i.e., contain the same elements in the same order).
Find the Duplicates in an Array

Program to find all duplicate elements in an array.

Automate Form Field Testing with Arrays

Program to iterate through a set of form input fields (stored in an array or list) to fill in test data using Selenium WebDriver.
Store Test Data in an Array or List for Selenium Data-Driven Testing

Program to read test data (e.g., usernames, passwords) from an array or list and automate form submissions in Selenium.
