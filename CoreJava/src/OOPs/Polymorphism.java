		 Statement execute multiple time with different result called as polymorphism
		 
		 Types - 
		 1) Compile time polymorphism - Bind between method implementation and method call
		 	statement happen during compile time is called as compile time polymorphism
		 	
		 		Example - 1) Method overloading - If a class having multiple method with same name
		 					 but different parameter
		 					 
		 				  2) Constructor overloading - having more than 1 constructor with different parameter
		 	
		 2) Run time polymorphism - bind between method implementation and method call statement
		 	happen during run time known as
		 	
		 		Example - Is a RelationShip
		 				  Method overriding - If a sub class has same method as declareed as its parent class
		 				  	Rules - 
		 				  		Must have same name as parent method
		 				  		must have same parameter
		 				  		must have Is-A relationship
		 				  		
		 				  	Use to provide specific implemantation
		 				  	
		 				  Derived typecasting - 
		 				  
		 	Note - We cannot override static method bauacse static mehod are bounded using static binding at 
		 	compile time
