	/*
	 OOPs is a concept or theory which helps to the programmer to represent the real world scenario
	 through programming.
	 
	 Object - is nothing but real world entity which has
	 	1) Properties
	 	2) Behavior  
	 	
	 Class - Class is a blue print of an object which define property and behavior as variable and method
	 		class act as template of an object and we can create multiple object of a class
	 		
	 Pilers OF OPPs - 
	 	1) Encapsulation -  is the process of wrapping a data and method into a single unit ( Example - Capsule)
	 	
	 	2) Polymorphism  -  Statement execute multiple time with different result( Example - One person having different 
	 						behavior like in classroom we behave like student, in market we behave like customer
	 						in Home we behave like Son, in company we behave like employee)
	 						
	 	3) Abstraction   -  Hiding lower level details and show only essential and relative details to customer
	 						( Example - ATM machine )
	 	
	 	4) Inheritance   -  The process of aquiring properties and behavior of a Super class to the Sub class 
		 				    is called as Inheritance (Example - Child and father relationship, Object class is
		 				    super most class of all class)
